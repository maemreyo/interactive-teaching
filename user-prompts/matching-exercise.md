Using the `task-create-form.md` template, create a matching exercise from the vocabulary in the uploaded document. For each word, provide a dropdown (`shadcn/ui` Select) with its definition and several incorrect definitions as options. Students should select the correct definition. Include a submit button to check answers. Add a subtle fade-in animation to each form field using `framer-motion`.
