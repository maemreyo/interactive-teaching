Using the `task-create-form.md` template, create a multiple-choice quiz based on the vocabulary in the uploaded document. For each vocabulary word, generate a question (e.g., "What is the definition of [word]?") and provide four options, one correct and three incorrect. Use `shadcn/ui` RadioGroup for the options. Include a submit button. Add a subtle fade-in animation to each question and its options using `framer-motion`.
